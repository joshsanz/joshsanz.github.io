# About me
I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in December 2024. Before starting grad school, I spent three years at MIT Lincoln Laboratory doing radar and wireless communications signal processing. My research while at Berkeley spanned ML for the physical layer of wireless communications, ML *using* wireless signals, and most recently generative modeling for data-scarce domains. I am passionate about taking tools from across domains and applying them in new and creative ways to solve real problems. I am unafraid to tackle challenging problems and acquire new skills to develop solutions. Outside of research, I love cooking, rock climbing, and running with my Mini Australian Shepherd, Vesemir.
