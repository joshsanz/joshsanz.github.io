## Lightly Supervised Machine Learning for Wireless Signals

### Interactive Supervision for Learning Wireless PHY

This chapter examines interactive supervision in learning wireless PHY communication, emphasizing how two independent agents can establish communication in a noisy channel with minimal coordination. The study explores a range of supervision levels, from basic feedback where agents merely echo received messages to full supervision where gradient information is shared. By framing communication as a cooperative learning problem, the chapter investigates how varying degrees of information sharing affect the learning process.

One of the primary technical achievements involves the development and analysis of different versions of the Echo protocol. The Echo with Private Preamble (EPP) protocol allows agents to learn communication without any shared reference signals, making it a minimal-information approach. In contrast, the Echo with Shared Preamble (ESP) protocol provides agents with a common preamble to facilitate learning. Additional variations include Loss Passing (LP), where agents share scalar loss values, and Gradient Passing (GP), where they exchange gradients, resembling an autoencoder-based training approach. The study evaluates these protocols under different conditions to determine the impact of supervision on the efficiency and robustness of learned communication.

Another significant aspect of the work is the examination of alienness in learning communication. Instead of assuming that agents use identical learning architectures, the study considers cases where they differ in their function approximators, hyperparameters, or initialization methods. The findings suggest that learning to communicate with an alien agent is not necessarily more difficult than learning with an identical agent. In some cases, pairing a fast-learning agent with a slow-learning agent improves learning speed and stability. This insight challenges the assumption that communication learning requires agents to be highly similar and suggests that structured diversity in agent design can be beneficial.

The evaluation focuses on bit error rate (BER) as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of these learning protocols. The results show that even with minimal shared information, agents can still learn to communicate, though the process requires significantly more training iterations compared to approaches that rely on direct supervision. The study also demonstrates that learned modulation schemes approach the performance of traditional modulation schemes, such as QPSK, even in cases where no explicit communication design is enforced. Furthermore, the experimental setup includes not only simulations but also real-world hardware tests using USRP radios, confirming that the observed learning behavior is not limited to theoretical or simulated environments.

Future work should address whether the Echo protocol can be considered a universal method for learning communication across different environments and agent designs. A formal proof of universality remains an open question. Expanding beyond two-agent interactions to multi-agent systems would provide a broader understanding of decentralized communication learning. Optimizing training efficiency remains an important direction, as the results indicate that minimal-information approaches like EPP require significantly longer training times. Further research could explore techniques to accelerate convergence without introducing explicit supervision. Finally, while this work focuses on wireless communication, similar interactive learning principles could apply to other domains, such as autonomous systems, robotic coordination, and human-AI collaboration.

### Environmental Supervision for Automatic Sensing and Calibration

This chapter focuses on environmental supervision for automatic sensing and calibration in distributed wireless networks. The increasing complexity of modern radio spectrum usage, combined with the need for efficient spectrum sharing, creates challenges in maintaining accurate environmental awareness for wireless systems. Cognitive radios and spectrum monitoring networks rely on precise information about their surroundings, including both the physical environment and spectrum occupancy, to make optimal decisions about signal transmission and reception. However, obtaining this information traditionally requires expensive infrastructure, coordinated sensing, and manual calibration. This chapter explores how signals of opportunity (SoOps) can be leveraged to enable automatic sensing and calibration without explicit cooperation from signal sources.

One of the main technical considerations revolves around the use of non-cooperative signals to extract information about both the radio environment and the sensing nodes themselves. Unlike conventional spectrum sensing, which merely detects signal presence, this approach takes advantage of physical properties inherent to all communication signals—such as cyclostationarity, frequency content, and known transmission structures—to infer additional details. By combining SoOps with external datasets, such as public databases of transmitter locations, the system can generate metadata that enhances environmental awareness and enables automatic calibration of sensor nodes.

A key achievement is the development of methods for automatic sensor evaluation and calibration. This system uses SoOps from sources such as ADS-B transmissions from airplanes and signals from LEO satellites to assess the performance and placement of spectrum sensors. These signals help determine factors such as field of view, frequency sensitivity, and obstruction levels without requiring manual verification. The approach is particularly relevant for crowd-sourced spectrum monitoring networks, where untrusted participants contribute data, and verifying the quality of each node remains a challenge. The results show that by processing ADS-B signals and comparing them with known aircraft locations, the system can estimate a sensor’s field of view and identify potential obstructions. Similarly, by analyzing Doppler shifts from satellite signals, the system can determine whether a node is operating correctly and assess its reception capabilities across different frequency bands.

Another significant contribution is the automatic generation of metadata related to sensor node placement and operational characteristics. The work demonstrates that indoor and outdoor environments can be distinguished based on variations in signal strength and multipath characteristics observed in ADS-B transmissions. Traditional spectrum sensing relies on user-supplied metadata, which can be inaccurate or intentionally falsified, particularly in crowd-sourced sensing applications. By treating human input as a noisy data source rather than an absolute reference, the proposed system provides a new method for verifying and supplementing metadata automatically.

The implications for future work are extensive. The methods developed in this chapter lay the foundation for more scalable and reliable spectrum sensing networks by reducing dependence on human intervention and manual calibration. Further research could explore the use of additional signals of opportunity beyond ADS-B and satellite transmissions, incorporating signals from terrestrial sources such as FM radio, cellular networks, and broadcast television. Improvements in signal processing techniques and machine learning models could enhance the accuracy of field-of-view estimation, obstruction detection, and metadata generation. Additionally, integrating these methods with emerging spectrum-sharing frameworks, such as CBRS and Wi-Fi 6E, could improve automated spectrum management and regulatory compliance.

Another promising direction is expanding the system’s capabilities for multi-node coordination in distributed networks. By aggregating data from multiple sensor nodes, the system could create a more comprehensive map of the radio environment, improving coverage estimates and interference detection. Future studies could also investigate methods for detecting and mitigating intentional data manipulation in crowd-sourced spectrum monitoring networks. The long-term goal is to enable autonomous, self-calibrating spectrum sensing systems that can operate at scale, reducing the need for expensive manual verification while enhancing the reliability of spectrum monitoring efforts.

### Towards Synthetic Datasets for Data-Scarce Domains

This chapter explores the challenges and solutions for generating synthetic datasets in domains with limited real-world data, particularly focusing on wireless signals. The success of large generative models in language and image domains depends on vast datasets collected from the internet. However, scientific fields like wireless communications lack such extensive datasets due to privacy concerns, legal restrictions, and the complexity of collecting real-world data. Without sufficient data, training robust machine learning models for wireless signal processing remains difficult.

One of the main technical considerations is the use of synthetic data to address these limitations. Wireless systems have extensive simulation tools, but simulations often fail to capture real-world imperfections. Existing work in wireless generative modeling typically relies on synthetic data alone, or fine-tunes models with small real-world datasets. This chapter examines whether large-scale synthetic datasets can help bridge the data scarcity gap without relying on real-world recordings, which are restricted by privacy laws and ethical concerns. The discussion highlights legal obstacles, including past court rulings and federal regulations that make public release of recorded wireless data legally risky. These constraints have significantly hindered the availability of diverse wireless datasets, unlike other fields where large public datasets drive innovation.

The study employs generative foundation models to create synthetic datasets that approximate real-world data distributions. Instead of training wireless-specific foundation models from scratch, the approach adapts models from other domains with more available data. By transforming time-series signals into spectrogram images, the study leverages pre-trained diffusion models from the image domain. Fine-tuning these models enables the generation of synthetic spectrograms that retain the essential characteristics of the original signals. The method is tested using EEG data as a stand-in for wireless signals, due to its similar privacy constraints and lower spectral complexity. The models are evaluated using statistical similarity metrics and downstream classification tasks to determine their effectiveness in preserving useful data features.

The results indicate that while synthetic data can improve model training, different generative approaches yield varying levels of success. Metrics like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) assess how closely synthetic data matches real data distributions, but high similarity does not always translate to better performance in machine learning tasks. Some synthetic datasets allow classifiers to perform well on real data, while others create models that only generalize within their own synthetic distribution. This discrepancy highlights the need for improved methods to ensure that synthetic datasets maintain both statistical similarity and practical utility for downstream applications.

Future research should focus on refining generative approaches to enhance their ability to produce high-quality synthetic datasets. Instead of relying on spectrogram transformations, direct synthesis of wireless signals using audio foundation models may provide better temporal consistency. Incorporating domain-specific constraints could improve the realism of generated data. Additionally, exploring techniques like federated learning and privacy-preserving synthetic data generation could help overcome legal and ethical barriers to dataset sharing. The application of these methods to real-world wireless signals remains an open challenge, but the potential for synthetic data to enable machine learning in data-scarce domains justifies continued investigation.
